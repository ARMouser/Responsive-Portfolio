	<p id="bio">

		Hello! Thank you for taking the time to visit my page. I am new to web developing, having come from a background in music education and technology repair. I formerly played the oboe and have worked with a marching band for 7 years<br> <br>

		I graduated from Appalachian State with a degree in Music Education in 2009, went on to study my masters in Music Performance for half a year in San Francisco before moving back to Charlotte, NC. I worked in computer and mobile device repair from 2013-2016 and stopped to pursue becoming a web developer. <br> <br>

		I currently live in Durham, NC with my boyfriend. I am enrolled with the Coding Boot Camp at Chapel Hill. In my downtime I love running, cooking and video games!
